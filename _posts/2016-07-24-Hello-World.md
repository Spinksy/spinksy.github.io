title: Hello Sunday Morning
---

I'm all about time management at the moment, with a young daughter, I need to squeeze in time to be productive wherever I can. So it's 6.10am on a Sunday morning, what better time to start a blog... 

There are a few times that I find are the best opportunities to get work done. 

- Early mornings
- On the commute
- Late nights

I have a job I love, and I often let my work creep in to my personal time. Whether that's staying back late in the office, logging on late at night or in the early morning just to do that one last thing. 
I think it's great being in a position to connect at any time to take care of something that might be bugging me, or act when inspiration hits. However, I always try to make sure
it doesn't get in the way of my outside of work life. 

Hence the early wake up this morning to try and get something done.
